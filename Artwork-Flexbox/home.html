I've always loved to color and for the last 15 years I've learned different techniques and tricks to digital artwork including creation and coloring. Here are two examples of my work. The one on the left, Joker, was colored by me in Highschool for a school project. It was completed in Adobe Photoshop. The picture on the right is a quick sketch I did a few months ago of a personalized character named Kohai. This was created on Procreate using an iPad. It's interesting to see what can be created through digital outlets!</p>
